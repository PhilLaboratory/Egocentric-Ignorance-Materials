## Folders

### code

#### experiments
This folder holds all stimuli, as well as html scripts for the administration of these oline experiments. Experiments are constructed using the JsPsych library and are hosted on Proliferate (Experiments 1a, 2a, 2b, and 2c) or DataPipe (Experiment 1b).

### data
